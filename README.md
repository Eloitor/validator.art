### What does this package do?

This package provides a function (`valid?`) that allows to check and validate strings, based on different built-in schemes/patterns, e.g e-mails, urls, etc.

### How do I use it?

Simply `import` it and use the included `valid?` function:

```red
import "validator"!

valid?.url "https://arturo-lang.io"
; => true

valid?.email "loremIpsum@
; => false
```

And we may also check more than one strings:

```red
valid?.email ["my@email.com", "info@google.com"]
; => true
```

> [!TIP]
> Different type of checks may accept different extra params, so you'd better have a look into the reference first! ðŸ˜‰
